<h1>Analyze MTA Data</h1>

<p>A friend of mine was given an interesting task by her college. She was asked to analyze MTA data to calculate acceleration of a bus for any stretch of a route. To compare this speed through the day and so on.</p>

<p>The only data she was given was the data provided by the MTA on their website. The data is a flat file of data points gathered by the bus every 30 (or so ) seconds thought the course of its day.</p>

<p>My friend only asked for pointers on manipulating and managing the data. I suggested that it would be best (and easiest) to put the 2GB of data into a SQL database. From there it would be easy to query the information with the hope of making it less flat.</p>

<p>After I showed my friend how to import the data in MySQL, I started playing around with the data. Needless to say I got hooked.</p>

<p>This project is to describe my progress as it relates to giving the data volume and providing basic analysis of the data. At the point of git-init I had already made some headway.</p>
